### Decentralized Property Registry
- This is Decentralized Property Registry smart contract project.
- The aim was to optimize the contract created to reduce gas cost for function and deployment cost.
- There are two contracts `src/Registry.sol` and `src/OptimizedRegistry.sol`, which are the same contract with same functionality but one is the optimized version of the other contract.
- There are improvements done in `compelteMutation` function to reduce its minimum Gas cost from 47198 to 30113
- Also improvements in overall contract to reduce deployment cost from 1191517 to 1152599.
